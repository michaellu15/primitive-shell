# Pioneer Shell (WIP)
### [Starting Programming Assignment](https://cse29.site/pa4)

<p>This is a primitive version of a shell. It started as a programming assignment for the course CSE 29 at the University of California San Diego. It had the primitive features of a shell, executing inputs using the fork(), exec(), wait() calls and including some basic, built-in commands including cd, exit, and history. I later expanded upon it to include new features including this list of items:</p>
<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>
<ul>
<li>Semi-colon Command Separation</li>
<li>&& and || Seperate Chaining</li>
<li>The built-in Command Exec</li>
<li>Subshell Support</li>
<li>Bang (!) Exit Code Negation</li>
<li>Multi-line Separation with \</li>
<li>Pipes!</li>
